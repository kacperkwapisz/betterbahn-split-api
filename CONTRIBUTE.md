### Submitting Your First Pull Request

Code contributions are the heart of an open-source project. Here is the basic workflow for submitting a Pull Request (PR):

1.  **Find or create an issue:** Every PR should relate to an existing issue. If one doesn't exist, create one and briefly discuss the planned change with the maintainers.
2.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the project's GitHub page.
3.  **Clone your fork locally:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/betterbahn-split-api.git
    ```
4.  **Create a new branch:** Choose a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/new-login-feature` or `fix/calculation-bug`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
    ```
5.  **Make your changes:** Implement your feature or fix the bug.
6.  **Add tests:** If you are adding a new feature, please include corresponding unit or integration tests.
7.  **Run the tests (Not implemented yet!):** Ensure that all tests pass successfully.
    ```bash
    # Example command, adapt it for your project
    pnpm test
    ```
8.  **Commit your changes:** Write a clear and concise commit message (see [Style Guides](#git-commit-messages)).
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new login feature (closes #123)"
    ```
9.  **Push your changes to your fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/descriptive-name
    ```
10. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request".
    - Choose the `main` branch of the original project as the base branch.
    - Give your PR a descriptive title and a detailed description of your changes. Reference the related issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
11. **Wait for the review:** The project maintainers will review your code and may leave feedback or request changes.

## Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps us automate changelog generation and keeps the project history readable.

Each commit message should consist of a type, an optional scope, and a description:
`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

- **feat:** A new feature.
- **fix:** A bug fix.
- **docs:** Changes to the documentation.
- **style:** Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no change in code logic).
- **refactor:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- **test:** Adding or correcting tests.
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

**Example:** `feat(auth): Implement OAuth2 authentication`
